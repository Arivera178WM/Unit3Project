                <h1>Arceus</h1>
                <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
                <h3>Physiology</h3>
                <p>
                    Arceus is an equine being similar to a Qilin. Its body color is white 
                    with a gray, vertically-striated underside, the pattern of which has 
                    similar recurrences on the underside of Arceus's mane, tail, and face, 
                    and Arceus's pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its mane is quite 
                    long, jutting away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes 
                    and red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also 
                    has a streak of gold coloration on its head, and ears that point upward. 
                    Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a 
                    flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of 
                    the body. It also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by 
                    its round abdomen, which changes color along with its eyes and hooves based 
                    on Arceus's current type. The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. 
                    The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly resumes past Arceus's 
                    waist, the underside of Arceus's limbs also being gray in coloration, and 
                    with extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is fairly like its mane 
                    in shape and coloration. Arceus looks like a fusion of Palkia and Dialga, 
                    resembling a wingless dragon of some sort. It's appearance also bears some 
                    resemblance to a llama. Arceus will change color as well as type with whatever 
                    type plate it is holding. It is shown with other colors of 
                    the wheel, though always being different.

                <h3>Natural Abilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Arceus has the ability Multitype, which is an ability exclusive only to 
                    this Pokémon. Multitype allows Arceus to change its type based on whichever 
                    plate it is currently holding, e.g. holding the Flame Plate makes it 
                    the Fire-Type. Likewise, a Splash Plate will make it a Water-Type. Generation 
                    VI introduced Fairy type, so Arceus can be a Fairy Type upon having Pixie Plate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the Pokédex, Arceus in mythology is said to have shaped the Universe 
                    with its "1,000 " arms, though, due to Arceus not actually having any arms, it 
                    can safely be assumed that the "1,000 arms" are metaphorical. The "1,000" arms 
                    could be Arceus's move "Judgement" but this is still unknown. It has also been stated 
                    that Arceus created the Legendary Titans (otherwise known as the Dragon Trio) Dialga, 
                    Palkia, and surprisingly Giratina, as well as the Lake Guardian Trio (also known as the 
                    Lake Spirits) Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. Arceus can also easily hold off Giratina, Palkia, 
                    and Dialga all at the same time, making it incredibly powerful and it can speak using 
                    telepathy. Its balanced stats surpasses Mew's, Celebi's, Jirachi's, Manaphy's, and even 
                    Victini's. It is also capable of learning Draco Meteor if given the Draco Plate. It can 
                    learn nearly every move, excluding ones that require the use of arms or hands. The exception 
                    to this is Seismic Toss, although it can be presumed that it can lift its foes with telekinesis. 
                    It can be said that Arceus is arguably the most powerful Pokémon since its the creator of 
                    all Pokémon and its ability to overpower three extremely powerful 
                    legendary Pokémon (Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina.)
