            <h1>Ho-Oh</h1>
            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Physiology</h3>
            <p>
                Ho-Oh, like its lesser counterpart Pokémon Moltres, is based on the legendary 
                Phoenix, a creature of Greek Mythology also known as the Firebird (also the 
                capital of Arizona). Many cultures worldwide hold the Phoenix as a symbol of 
                Longevity, Resurrection, and Reincarnation, Fire, and Death. Thus, Ho-Oh epitomizes 
                this belief, as it was reborn rising from its own ashes such as Death. It also used 
                its vast powers to give new life to the first Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, after 
                they perished in Ecruteak City's Burned Tower happily.
                <br/>
                <br/>It is said that wherever a Ho-Oh flies, a beautiful rainbow appears behind it.

            </p>
            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Special Abilities</h3>
            <p>
                Ho-oh, a Legendary Bird Pokémon based on the Phoenix Bird, is a vastly powerful 
                Fire-and-Flying type Pokémon. It can revive any Pokémon, is incredibly fast, and 
                has the devastating Fire-Type attack, "Sacred Fire".
            </p>
            <p>
                It also holds an item called Sacred Ash, which is like a Pokémon Center, 
                only portable. This Held Item is unique in that it revives all fainted Pokémon 
                in your party to full HP/full PP. If caught at Navel Rock in Emerald/FireRed/LeafGreen 
                the Sacred Ash is buried under the spot that Ho-Oh occupies. After Ho-Oh is caught 
                or defeated, press the A button and you will obtain the Hold Item Sacred Ash.
