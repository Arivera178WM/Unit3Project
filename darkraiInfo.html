            <h1>Darkrai</h1>
            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Physiology</h3>
            <p>
                The top of its body is connected to the lower half by a tiny waist, giving 
                it an hourglass shaped figure. It has a red spiky growth around its neck 
                and a long white mane flows from its head, obscuring one of its blue eyes. 
                Its thin arms have three claws each, with three spiky protrusions above each 
                elbow. Its shoulders also have long tatters and it appears to be wearing an old 
                ripped cloak or dress. It is able to extend stilt-like extensions to use as legs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Darkrai resembles a ghost or a haunted spirit but it is interesting to note that, 
                despite it's design, Darkrai is not a Ghost type, instead being a pure Dark type.
            </p>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
                Darkrai is shown to be mysterious, sinister and ominous, yet extremely misunderstood. 
                It’s also shown to be a creature of habit for it causes nightmares, regardless of who it 
                affects. However, there is very little evidence to prove it maliciously scares humans on purpose.
                <br/>
                <br/>It is hostile to Cresselia.
            </p>
            <h3>Game info</h3>
            <p>
                Darkrai first appeared in the Generation IV games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. To obtain it, 
                a player would have had to receive a Mystery Gift during a special promotion. It is also 
                obtainable by using a cheat device to either receive the Mystery Gift or walk 
                to the island it is located on.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia, Darkrai featured in a special mission named Liberate 
                the Tower. It can be found in the location where Darkrai helped you before. It uses its ability, 
                Dark Power, to fend off Team Dim Sun. However, the mission is no longer available for download. 
                It was possible to send Darkrai to Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.
            </p>
            <P>
                In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time And Explorers of Darkness, Darkrai is the main 
                ntagonist of those games. It is discovered that Darkrai was the reason that the Hero was 
                turned into a Pokémon and lost his or her memory when he or she had gone back in time with 
                Grovyle to stop the temporal tower from breaking and causing Dialga to turn into Primal Dialga. 
                After the final battle against Darkrai, he attempts to escape in a time portal, when Palkia, 
                who is angered that Darkrai used him, shows up and destroys the time portal as Darkrai is halfway 
                through it. He sustains a lot of damage, loses his memory and gets banished to an unknown place 
                which is ironic seeing how he was the reason that the hero lost his or her memory.
