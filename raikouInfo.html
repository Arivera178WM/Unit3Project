            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Physiology</h3>
            <p>
                    Raikou is a quadruped, yellow feline Pokémon with black stripes 
                    on its body. Its iris is red in color with a black pupil. It has 
                    a purple mane on its back, with white fur around its face. It 
                    has a thin, light blue colored tail with a spark shaped figure at 
                    its tip. It has a black forehead plate, with a light blue muzzle in

            </p>
            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Natural Abilities</h3>
            <p>
                    It has the Pressure ability which decreases the target's PP if 
                    they use that move on Raikou. It can also have Volt Absorb as its 
                    other ability if obtained from the Dream World.
            </p>
            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
                    Raikou is a Sabretooth Tiger-like creature. It carries rain clouds 
                    on its back which let it fire Thunderbolts at will. In the Pokédex, 
                    it states that it "descends with the lightning", and it "races across 
                    the land barking a cry that sounds like crashing thunder". While running, 
                    it stores up static electricity, then shoots off the excess. It is also 
                    said to help other Electric Pokémon if they are in danger.
            </p>
            <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
            <h3>Game info</h3>
            <p>
                    In Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Raikou roams around Kanto if the 
                    player character's Starter Pokémon was Squirtleand they have beaten 
                    the Elite Four. In FireRed and LeafGreen, it is very hard to catch 
                    because it will flee unless your Pokémon out has the ability 
                    Shadow Tag. It appears at Level 50.
            </p>
            <p>
                    In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the player could get a Shiny 
                    Raikou at Gamestop on January 31 through February 6, 2011, which 
                    later was given out via Wi-Fi in late February 2011. You can also 
                    get it at Kanto Route 25, then the Burned Tower. It appears at Level 
                    40 at both Route 25 and the Burned Tower.
