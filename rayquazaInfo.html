                <h1>Rayquaza</h1>
                <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
                <h3>Physiology</h3>
                <p>
                    Rayquaza is a long green serpentine Pokémon with yellow eyes. It has 
                    pink lining on the mouth. It has yellow, linked, circular markings on 
                    its entire body. In Mega form, it has a Delta-shaped jaw on its mouth 
                    and an elongated serpent body. As Mega Rayquaza, it is more aggressive and powerful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a natural ability, Rayquaza can float and control the speed, direction 
                    and altitude of it's levitation. Despite not having used any of these 
                    characteristics in battle throughout its appearances in the anime, all 
                    the Rayquazas have very sharp claws on the hands, very sharp teeth and a 
                    very powerful constrictor body. It's not known if Mega Rayquaza can use 
                    its energy whips/tentacles as weapons or regular body members. Naturally, 
                    given it can travel through the ozone layer safely and even higher layers of 
                    Earth's atmosphere, it demands very little air to live and possibly none. If 
                    none, it could possibly travel through space, since the layer that intermediates 
                    the Ozone layer and the troposphere can hit -60 °C or -76 F. If the belief that 
                    Rayquaza is responsible for destroying meteors still in the higher atmospheric 
                    layers is true, it would have to be able to endure temperatures that can reach 
                    -100 °C, or even -148 F. It shows that Rayquaza have an great resistance to cold, 
                    which is ironic since it has double weakness to the Ice-typing. Despite its resistance, 
                    it is not known if Rayquaza can endure the -270 °C or -454 F of an absolute space vacuum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to its nature of absorbing the ozone layer particles, if Rayquaza is at 
                    Alola region, it is a direct predator of Minior, should the latter Pokémon died 
                    in its core form at limited time and had its particles become one with the 
                    universe for Rayquaza to feed.
                </p>
                <h3>Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                    Rayquaza seems to be a very aggressive and territorial Pokémon, shown when 
                    it attacked a Deoxys. Yet, its aggression toward Deoxys could derive from the 
                    belief that Rayquaza is commissioned with the natural duty of shielding Earth 
                    from meteorites and similar threats, as was hinted in the Delta Episode bonus 
                    in the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Pokémon games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Hoenn region's mythology, it was said that Rayquaza stopped the fight 
                    between Groudon and Kyogre. It lives in the ozone layer far above the clouds 
                    and cannot be seen from the ground. It is noted for protecting its territory 
                    fiercely. An example of this was when a Deoxys, which had fallen from space in 
                    a meteor, appeared, Rayquaza thought that the Deoxys was invading its territory and so, 
                    attacked the Deoxys. This was in Destiny Deoxys, the 7th Pokemon movie.
                </p>
                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                <p>
                    Rayquaza does not evolve normally. Rayquaza can Mega Evolve however, after learning the move, Dragon Ascent.
