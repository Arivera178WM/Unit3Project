                <h1>Mewtwo</h1>
                <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
                <h3>Physiology</h3>
                <p>
                        Mewtwo is a bipedal feline-like Pokémon. Its appearance 
                        is loosely based on Mew, with a more of a mutated humanoid 
                        look in addition to its feline traits. Its body is purple 
                        and it has three fingers on each hand. Mewtwo projects 
                        a faint purple aura when at full power.
                </p>
                <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
                <h3>Forms</h3>
                <p>
                        Mewtwo has an Anime/Manga exclusive form named Armored Mewtwo 
                        in the anime, and M2 Bind in the Manga. In the anime the form 
                        increases all of Mewtwo's Psychic abilities, and in the manga 
                        it allows Giovanni to control it. Mewtwo also has another form 
                        exclusive to the Pocket Monsters manga, where it takes on the 
                        DNA of a Clefairy, becoming a shorter, fatter and much stronger 
                        version of itself. Titling itself "Mewthree", it started its quest 
                        of cooking the best bacon ever until Satoshi managed to calm it 
                        down with his bacon. After going into a tantrum, screaming out 
                        "This isn't even my final form!", Mewthree split back into Clefairy and Mewtwo.

                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                        Mewtwo is highly adept at utilizing its Psychic powers, displaying 
                        telekinesis and telepathy as well. It utilizes its telepathy to 
                        communicate with humans and translate the Pokémon language. It 
                        uses its telekinesis to fly, block special abilities, and expunge 
                        people's recollections as optically discerned in Mewtwo Strikes Back.

                <h3>Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                        As evidence of its immense power, Mewtwo is by far one of the most 
                        domineering Pokémon in the series. It's power is so great to the point 
                        where it can endure immense torture in Mewtwo Returns, and teleport a 
                        lake miles long underground! Proven in the first Pokémon Movie, Mewtwo 
                        holds a large degree of pride in its personality. In fact, it general nature 
                        is so complex that it borderlines that of human levels with itself capable 
                        of learning and evolving just to get the upper hand in battle. Indeed, Mewtwo's 
                        title of "The World's Most Powerful Pokémon" shouldn't be undermined.
                </p>
                <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                        Mewtwo is extremely arrogant, cold and aggressive. He is also anti social 
                        and does not speak or smile much, however he has been seen smirking when being 
                        sure of himself or if he thinks lowly of someone.
                </p>
                <!--This is the format for the paragraph header and the related paragraph of each info section-->
                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                <p>
                        Mewtwo cannot evolve. However, it can Mega Evolve with the 
                        use of a Mewtwonite X or a Mewtwonite Y.
