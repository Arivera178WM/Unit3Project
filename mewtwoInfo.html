            <h1>Mewtwo</h1>
            <h3>Physiology</h3>
            <p>
                    Mewtwo is a bipedal feline-like Pokémon. Its appearance 
                    is loosely based on Mew, with a more of a mutated humanoid 
                    look in addition to its feline traits. Its body is purple 
                    and it has three fingers on each hand. Mewtwo projects 
                    a faint purple aura when at full power.
            </p>
            <h3>Forms</h3>
            <p>
                    Mewtwo has an Anime/Manga exclusive form named Armored Mewtwo 
                    in the anime, and M2 Bind in the Manga. In the anime the form 
                    increases all of Mewtwo's Psychic abilities, and in the manga 
                    it allows Giovanni to control it. Mewtwo also has another form 
                    exclusive to the Pocket Monsters manga, where it takes on the 
                    DNA of a Clefairy, becoming a shorter, fatter and much stronger 
                    version of itself. Titling itself "Mewthree", it started its quest 
                    of cooking the best bacon ever until Satoshi managed to calm it 
                    down with his bacon. After going into a tantrum, screaming out 
                    "This isn't even my final form!", Mewthree split back into Clefairy and Mewtwo.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
                    Mewtwo is highly adept at utilizing its Psychic powers, displaying 
                    telekinesis and telepathy as well. It utilizes its telepathy to 
                    communicate with humans and translate the Pokémon language. It 
                    uses its telekinesis to fly, block special abilities, and expunge 
                    people's recollections as optically discerned in Mewtwo Strikes Back.
            </p>
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
                    As evidence of its immense power, Mewtwo is by far one of the most 
                    domineering Pokémon in the series. It's power is so great to the point 
                    where it can endure immense torture in Mewtwo Returns, and teleport a 
                    lake miles long underground! Proven in the first Pokémon Movie, Mewtwo 
                    holds a large degree of pride in its personality. In fact, it general nature 
                    is so complex that it borderlines that of human levels with itself capable 
                    of learning and evolving just to get the upper hand in battle. Indeed, Mewtwo's 
                    title of "The World's Most Powerful Pokémon" shouldn't be undermined.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
                    Mewtwo is extremely arrogant, cold and aggressive. He is also anti social 
                    and does not speak or smile much, however he has been seen smirking when being 
                    sure of himself or if he thinks lowly of someone.
            </p>
            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>
                    Mewtwo cannot evolve. However, it can Mega Evolve with the 
                    use of a Mewtwonite X or a Mewtwonite Y.
